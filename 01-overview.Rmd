# Set up your computer

## Installation
- Install R 3.4.1 from https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/ . (Requires administrator privellege)
- Install RStudio Desktop free version from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- Follow [these steps](03-git.html#install-git) to install Git for Windows. (Requires administrator privellege)

## Installation Verification 
1. Launch RStudio and you should see a program window like this: <center><img src="http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/01-rstudio.png"></center>
1. Click the **File** menu, select **New Project...**, then **Version Control** and **Git**;
1. Copy & paste this URL: https://github.com/cities/datascience2017.git into the the Repository URL textbox; 
1. Click **Create Project**.

If you see a popup box that says "Clone Repsitory" with a progress bar and then RStudio refreshes, then your installation is working.

# Class project

For the class project, you are expected to create a R package with the following requirements and commit it to GitHub:
1. Contains at least one self-contained function;
1. Completed with necessary documentation;
1. Passes R package check and test(s);
1. [Advanced] includes a vignette that demonstrates the usage of the package.

You can use code from your current work or start from scratch. Take the feasibility of completing in a week into consideration when selecting ideas.
        
If you don't have a feasible project idea at the moment, consider writing a R package that visualizes the bike counts on Hawthorne and Tilikum. Daily traffic counts data for these two bridges can be found [here](https://github.com/cities/datascience2017/data). At the minimum, your package should be able to:
- Visualize bike counts on either or both bridges based on the data frame passed in;
- Plot daily bike counts for any specified period;
- [Advanced] Plot daily, weekly, or monthly bike counts based on an frequency argument.
