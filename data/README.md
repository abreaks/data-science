- Description: Global Historical Climate Network includes daily land surface observations from around the world. The GHCN-Daily was developed to meet the needs of climate analysis and monitoring studies that require data at a sub-monthly time resolution (e.g., assessments of the frequency of heavy rainfall, heat wave duration, etc.). The dataset includes observations from World Meteorological Organization, Cooperative, and CoCoRaHS networks. If observed, the station dataset includes max and minimum temperatures, total precipitation, snowfall, and depth of snow on ground. Some U.S. station data are typically delayed only 24 hours.
