1. What is the difference between a data.frame and tibble? How do you convert between them?
1. Import the bike counts data for [Hawthorne](https://github.com/cities/datascience2017/raw/master/data/Hawthorne%20Bridge%20daily%20bike%20counts%202012-2016%20082117.xlsx) and [Tilikum](https://github.com/cities/datascience2017/raw/master/data/Tilikum%20Crossing%20daily%20bike%20counts%202015-16%20082117.xlsx) in Microsoft Excel format;
1. Import the [Portland weather data in csv format](https://github.com/cities/datascience2017/raw/master/data/NCDC-CDO-PortlandOR.csv);
1. [Challenge] Import the [Portland weather data in fixed width format](https://github.com/cities/datascience2017/raw/master/data/NCDC-CDO-USC00356750.txt);
1. For those already familiar with R, create a R script that loads, cleans, and visualizes the bike counts data as well as temperature and precipitation data (using data from Weather Station `USC00356750`); <p>
for those not yet familiar with R, think about how you would go about doing these tasks with the software you are most comfortable with.
